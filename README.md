# Insulator Detection and Classification 


## Insulator Detection

This represents the initial model in the pipeline where images will be trained to predict the presence of ceramic insulators along with performing object localization using bounding boxes

This can be found under `insulator_detection/`

## Insulator 

The second part of the pipeline will be used to classify the insulator as broken or not broken

This can be found under `broken_vs_unbroken/`
